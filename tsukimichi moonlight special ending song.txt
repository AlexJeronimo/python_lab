[Aa Jinsei ni Namida Ari]
(Ah, there are tears in my life )
Tomoe Version
It can be painful if it's easy because people aren't born
A rainbow appears after tears
She walks and walks firmly
Give her your own way

It seems that courage and courage are indispensable.
If you get sick, someone will go first
Even though I came later
If you don't want to cry

It's just one thing that happens to people.
There is no return afterwards
Tomorrow's day, the day of the day, the day of the day
Let's aim for it, raise your face

There is a smile when it is like tears caused by people
It's not that bad.
Rather than living without doing anything
Let's seek something and live


Makoto Version
It can be painful if it's easy because people aren't born
A rainbow appears after tears
I'm walking, I'm going
Take a look at your own way

It seems that courage and courage are indispensable.
If you get sick, someone will go first
Even though I came later
If you don't want to cry

There is a smile when it is like tears caused by people
It's not that bad.
Rather than living without doing anything
Let's seek something and live
